            <h1>IP Addresses Packets and Routing</h1>
            <p>
                Internet is the network of the network it links to billions and more devices together around the globe.
            </p>

            <p>
                The protocol is well knows set of rules and standards used to communicate between
                machines if users agree to communicate then devices can have communication.
            </p>
            <p>
                One of the most important protocols used in internet communication is called internet protocol (IP).
                IP address help to Communicate between two computers.
                When one user sends a message to another computer, the user receives the IP Address from another computer for the response.
            </p>
            <p>
                For example: laptop and phone connect each other by Wi-Fi and Wi-Fi connected to the internet service provider (ISP) then (ISP) connected to billions and more devices around the world.
            </p>
            <p>
                All the different devices on the internet have unique addresses. An address on the internet is just several each device given name by numbers.
                IP addresses are like a home mailing address. IP address represented in the bits, with 32 bits long and 8 bits of each part of the address.
            </p>
            <p>
                The first part of the IP address content country/network, region/network, subnetwork, and then device.
                This is an IPv4 version designed in 1973 and adopted in 1980. It provides more than 4 billion unique addresses to connect to the internet.
                Since almost everyone used internet devices so 4 billion unique addresses are not enough.
                Then IPv6 used 128 bits and it provides 340 undecillion unique addresses to connect to the internet.
            </p>
            <p>
                Information send one computer to another computer is called is a packet of information. Many kinds of digital information can be sent with IP packets such as music, videos, etc. Each packet has its internet address of where it came from and where is going. Routers act like traffic managers to keep packets moving smoothly. If one router is heavy traffic, then the packet will look for a different router to move the packet to the destination.
                Every router keeps track of multiple passes to send the packets and take the cheap path for each piece of the database on the destination IP Address

            </p>
            <p>
                Requesting the data and be sure to receive all data by Transmission Control Protocol (TCP).
                It manages the sending and receiving of all data as packets.
            </p>
            <p>
                TCP/IP and routing break down and transport packets in the small packet.
                Those packets are built by binary sequences of 1s and 0s are sent physically send by wires, cables, and Wi-Fi.
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, friend send you a video and when packets arrive TCP check for all the parts of the video by checklist.
                Once the packets are being received TCP sign for delivery; however, if TCP does not sign the delivery then some parts are missing from the packet and notify the sender.
            </p>
            <p>
                More router we add then more reliable. We can grow and scale the internet without interrupting service.
                The Internet is made of 100 of thousands of networks and billions of computers connected physically these different systems make up the internet connection to each other, communicate with each other, and work together because of agrees upon standards for how data is sent around the internet.
            </p>
            <p>
                Computing devices or router along the internet help all the packets make the way to the destination, packets are reassembled in the order.
                This activity happens every moment by sending mail, web browsing, video chatting, using an app, devices talk.
